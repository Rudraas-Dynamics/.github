## 🔬 What We Do

We focus on the complete cycle of an automation project, from initial concept and mathematical modeling to physical deployment and testing.

* **Modeling and Simulation:** Creating mathematical models of dynamic systems (e.g., in MATLAB/Simulink or Python) to predict behavior.
* **Controller Design:** Designing and tuning control algorithms, such as **PID** (Proportional-Integral-Derivative), **State-Space**, and advanced techniques like **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**.

* **Hardware Implementation:** Programming microcontrollers (**Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi**) and PLCs for real-time control applications.
* **Robotics:** Working on mobile robotics, robotic manipulators, and developing kinematic/dynamic control systems.
* **Industrial Automation:** Exploring SCADA systems, HMI interfaces, sensors, actuators, and industrial communication protocols (e.g., Modbus, CAN).
* **Data Acquisition & Analysis:** Implementing systems to collect, process, and analyze system performance data for optimization.
